# demo
This project is used for showing using Vue as a frontend framework to achieve few things:
1. Frontend dashboard live streaming
2. Animation
3. Router solution
4. Mixing Vue project in other framework

I've created seperate pages for each above to demonstrate.
* `/`: A color picker dashboard
* `/404`: A 404 page
* `gallery`: A video gallary page

For the full features currently support each page, see https://github.com/ts-xie/demo/wiki.

Do note that I'm trying to not use ES6 and some Vue features like [single file components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html#Introduction)
because I didn't set up compile process of Vue for demo purpose, but we do have it setted up for production Vue projects.
